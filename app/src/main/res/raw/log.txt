    Project forked from github.
    Learned to use Log.h for debugging.
    Identified how to use shape and world objects.
    Created nested loop to loop through world object.
    Created another nested loop to loop through shape object.
    Was able to loop through world object with shape object
    committed and pushed project to github
    Added comparison between shape and world object.
    As the shape object looped through the world, if the black squares of the shape matched
        the blue squares of the world, it would return true.
    Committed and pushed project to github

    Reversed the boolean matching shape and world object
    Shape now fits into the world, instead of matching with the blue squares
    Talked to professor Tribelhorn about possible edge case where shapes on very edge wont match

    Added match, rotateCW, and reverseArray methods
    RotateCW method was created with help from: www.geeksforgeeks.org/rotate-a-matrix-by-90-degree-in-clockwise-direction-without-using-any-extra-space/
    reverseArray method was created with help from: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-to-reverse-the-rows-in-a-2d-array/
    I moved all code from solve into match method so it could be called multiple times
    Added to solve method, so it tests all rotations of the shape object
    Pushed project to github
